Hi there and welcome to my website!

I'm Nicola, I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Aalto University, Finland, and I hope to graduate by the end of 2025. 

My research interests span Model-based Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models. I am also the organiser of a seminar on [Large Language Models](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science/llm-seminar) at Aalto University.

My plan for this website is to add a series of blogs reflecting on my experiences on the PhD, my research interests, my past research and what I learned from it.
